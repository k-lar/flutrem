# flutrem

A continuation of my `*rem` series of programs (But this time on mobile).  
This is the first mobile version that I made, so the user experience might not be the greatest,
but I tried the best that I could with the little experience I have with Flutter.

It's surprisingly hard to make a notes/reminders app without a database running in the background,
so I ended up using sqflite for that. Next time I'll try simply making a file and iterating through
the lines like all my other `*rem` programs do.
